Visur features:
 - Inspired by helix, screen, tmux, warp terminal, rust and vim  (Check these programs out to get more ideas)
 - Study rust, and learn to use it, we may shift over to using rust instead of Java for hyperbase.

Features inspired by helix:
 - auto-complete : commands inside editor
 - tutorial helper popup windows that show a list of possible commands
 - file picker which shows you contents of files you are browsing, and is very fast.
