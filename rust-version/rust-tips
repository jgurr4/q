RUST TIPS:
Generate a new project which initializes with git and generates .gitignore:
  - cargo new project-name

Build the project (cd to the directory first)
 - cargo build

compile a file (only if you didn't use cargo already)
 - rustc filename.rs

run a compiled file:
 - ./target/debug/filename

Build and run a file using cargo at same time:
 - cargo run

Check that the file compiles correctly without generating a binary:
 - cargo check

Compile a project for release in production: (Builds with optimizations)
 - cargo build --release

Run tests:
 - cargo test

Create a new package inside current:
 - mkdir foo && cd foo
 - cargo init .

Get help for specific cargo commands:
 - cargo help clean

Search for packages:
 - cargo search <package-name>
